          <h3>Best States to Move To If You're Under 40</h3>

          <p>It's no secret that young professionals are willing to relocate to make their next career move. The question that often
            arises: Where should I go? How do I know what's best for me? The latest census data can help us understand what states are great places to look!
          </p>

          <p>At a glance, there isn't a clear correlation between age and income at the state level. This means that the median age of a state isn't the best indicator
            of the median salary there. This is good news for people of all ages looking to make a career jump soon!
          </p>

          <p>The state that immediately jumps out to us may come as a surprise to you. With a median age of 30.5 and a median income 
            of about $61,000, its clear there's an energetic and productive business community. Another place that surprised is Alaska. Despite its remoteness,
            its low median age of 33 and median income of over $71,000 make it seem appealing. Of course, you'll need to cosider other factors such as the cost of living and the kind of work availabe before making the big move. 
          </p>

          <p>If you're stuck somewhere like West Virginia or Arkansas, where median age is on the higher side and median income is depressed, it might be time to hit the road!</p>
